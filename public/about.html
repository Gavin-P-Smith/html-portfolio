<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have worked in the Information Technology space for over 17 years. 
  I enjoy the study of and implimentation of new technologies and am particularly 
  excited about how the advances of A.I. and Low/No code solutions are going to influence the sector.</p>

<p>My historical role in the IT space is in the capacity of Project Managment, but I firmly believe
  that unless you have a deeper technical understanding of what it is your development team are busy developing
  your unlikely to comprehend the challenges they face.

<p>To relax, I enjoy cooking and I am a new painter exploring my "artistic" side.</p>
